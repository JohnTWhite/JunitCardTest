/*
 * This simple program attempts best SOLID 
 * practices by limiting classes to have a 
 * single need for change. 
 * 
 * It defers
 * functionality with interfaces and 
 * inheritance. Trying to keep classes 
 * open for extensions, and closed to
 * modification. 
 * 
 * Using the simpleInterest interface with
 * each card class (and each child class of
 * card class), wallet class, and person 
 * class. This allows a clear understanding
 * across classes. This interface segregation
 * is utilized beyond this interface as well.
 * 
 * Each child class of the creditCard class
 * is able to be substitute with one 
 * another. This attempts to demonstrate the
 * authors understanding of the Liskovs 
 * Substitution Principle. 
 * 
 * And classes are initialized by the caller
 * opposed to the class, illustrating a 
 * degree of dependency inversion.
